*** This text file contains a tree representation stored in the GuessTree
*** class. Text at the same level of indentation represents
*** nodes on the same layer of the tree. Vertical lines branch off onto horizontal
*** lines which connect parent nodes to child nodes. Each node contains a sequence
*** of letters (shownn in quotation marks) that represents the sequence of letters
*** that must be received from the new query file in order to navigate the the given
*** node. Following this is a series of up to 5 Strings (enclosd in sqaure brackets)
*** which are the five guesses that will be made if that given sequence of letters is
*** received. Happy reading!
